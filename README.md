# GOMS-CICB_Predictive_Model
Develops a reproducible biomarker prediction model for combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade (CICB) response in early-stage I-II cancers. Integrates multi-omics data (metagenomic, spatial meta-transcriptomic, metabolomic) and uses advanced feature selection and deep learning. Automated with Snakemake and Nextflow for reproducibility.
