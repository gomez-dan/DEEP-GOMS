### Overview
The GOMS-CICB Predictive Model project aims to develop a reproducible next-generation biomarker prediction model for combinatorial immune checkpoint blockade (CICB) response. This model leverages advanced machine learning techniques and integrates multi-omics data, including metagenomic, spatial meta-transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, to identify reproducible gut microbiome signatures (GOMS) associated with early-stage I-II cancers.

## Key Features
Multi-Omics Data Integration: Combines shotgun metagenomic sequencing, FISH assays, spatial meta-transcriptome analysis (SMTa), and metabolomic profiling to provide a comprehensive view of the gut microbiome.
Advanced Feature Selection: Utilizes techniques like LASSO, Ridge Regression, and feature importance from tree-based models to select the most relevant features.
Metadata Integration: Incorporates strain-resolution, strain-responsive, and strain-efficacy metadata to enhance the predictive power of the model.
Deep Learning Models: Employs deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for complex data integration and prediction tasks.
Pipeline Automation: Uses tools like Snakemake and Nextflow to automate the data processing and analysis pipeline, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

data/: Contains raw, processed, and external datasets.
